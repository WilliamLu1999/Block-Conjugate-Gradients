This is the AM-SURE Summer Research at NYU Courant. The research will be conducted under the supervision of Florian Wechsung.

The project will focus on developing a faster converging algorithm for solving multiple linear system simultaneously. In addition, we will study this in the context of fluid flow simulations, with the goal of improving an existing solver for Navier-Stokes and Stokes equations.
